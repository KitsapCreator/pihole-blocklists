# Pi-hole Blocklists
## Summary
In the spirit of pihole users and creators, I wanted to create my own blocklists as another option for users to choose from. However, I didn't just want to create yet another personal blocklist that I dumped on the internet just because I thought a few folks might like yet another option, I wanted to get the community involved in building these lists so all of us could benefit from all of our contributions. On that note, welcome!
## Disclaimer
The lists contained here are provided as is, with no warranty as to their accuracy. It is your responsibility to whitelist/blacklist as you see fit for your needs and your enviroment. This is due to how often the lists can change from additions and deletions. These lists are provided free of charge, are open for use by anyone, and are maintained by volunteers in their spare time.
# Getting Started
## Start Using
All lists are accessible using `blocklists.kitsapcreator.com/<blocklist-name-here>.txt`, or `blocklists.kitsapcreator.com/social/<blocklist-name-here>.txt` for social network blocklists. Basically, just put the path for the list you want after `blocklists.kitsapcreator.com`.

This domain uses the Cloudflare CDN (Content Delivery Network) for accelerated delivery around the world, so you shouldn't experience much delay in pulling updates from these lists. Also, feel free to ping and pull updates as often as you wish; the more the merrier.
## Contribute
1. Start by searching lists for the domains you wish to propose additions to avoid duplicates.
2.  Fork the repo, make your changes, then create a pull request so changes can be discussed.
* Use these same steps can be used when proposing subtractions.
* Use the Issues tab to report false positives and other problems.
* Before creating an issue, look to see if your problem has already been raised by someone else to prevent duplicate issues.
* If you don't want to mess around with editing files and creating a pull request yourself, simply create an issue with the domain(s) that you propose to add along with what list you propose to put them in.
## Tips and Tricks
* Use forks to regulate list updates if you don't want frequent changes. In this way you control when changes reach your setup.
