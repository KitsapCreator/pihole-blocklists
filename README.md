# Pi-hole Blocklists
## Summary
In the spirit of pihole users and creators, I wanted to create my own blocklists as another option for users choose from. However, I didn't just want to create yet another personal blocklist that I dumped on the internet just because I thought a few folks might like yet another option, I wanted to get the community involved in building these lists so all of us could benefit from all of our contributions. On that note, welcome!
